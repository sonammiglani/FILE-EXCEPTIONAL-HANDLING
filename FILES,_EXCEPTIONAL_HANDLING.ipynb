To access members (functions, classes, variables) of the module, you need to use the module name as a prefix (e.g., module_name.function_name()). It keeps the namespace clean and explicitly indicates where each member originates from. from module_name import member_name: This statement imports specific members directly into the current namespace. You can then use these members without the module name prefix (e.g., function_name()). While convenient, it can lead to namespace pollution if multiple modules have members with the same name. For example, con\n","\n","# Q7-How can you handle multiple exceptions in python?\n","\n","A7-Python offers several ways to handle multiple exceptions that might occur within a try block: Multiple except blocks: This is the most straightforward way, where each except block handles a specific exception type.

The basic steps are: Try block: Enclose the code that might raise an exception within a try block. This signals to Python that this section of code needs monitoring for potential errors. Except block(s): Follow the try block with one or more except blocks. Each except block specifies the type of exception it can handle. If an exception occurs within the try block and its type matches an except block, the code within that except block will execute. Optional else block: After the try and except blocks, an optional else block can be included. The code within the else block executes only if no exceptions were raised in the try block. Optional finally block: Regardless of whether an exception occurred or was caught, the code within the optional finally block will always execute. This is often used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources. Raise statement: To explicitly raise an exception, the raise statement is used, followed by the exception to be raised. This is useful for custom error handling or re-raising exceptions\n","\n","# Q13-Why is memory management important in python?\n","\n","A13-While Python's automatic memory management simplifies memory handling, it's essential to optimize memory usage, especially in memory-intensive applications. Here are some practical tips: - Minimize unnecessary object creation. - Use built-in data structures like generators and iterators for memory-efficient iteration.\n","\n","# Q14-What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n","\n","A14-The try and except blocks are fundamental to exception handling in programming. The try block encloses code that might raise an exception. If an exception occurs within the try block, the program's control flow immediately jumps to the corresponding except block. The except block specifies how to handle the exception, allowing the program to recover gracefully instead of crashing. This mechanism enables developers to anticipate potential errors, implement appropriate responses, and maintain the program's stabilit\n","\n","# Q15-How does pythons's garbage collection system works?\n","\n","Python employs a hybrid garbage collection system that combines reference counting with a generational garbage collector to manage memory automatically, identifying and reclaiming memory occupied by unused objects. Here's a breakdown: Reference Counting: Python keeps track of how many references (pointers) point to each object. When an object's reference count reaches zero, meaning no part of the program is using it, the object is eligible for garbage collection and its memory is freed. Generational Garbage Collection: This mechanism addresses the limitations of pure reference counting, particularly with circular references (where objects reference each other and their reference counts never reach zero). Python classifies objects into generations (0, 1, and 2) based on how long they've survived previous garbage collection cycles. New objects are placed in generation 0, and if they survive a collection, they move to generation 1, and so on. The garbage collector runs periodically, focusing on younger generations first, and less frequently on older generations. The generational garbage collector uses a \"mark and sweep\" algorithm to identify and collect unreachable objects, including those involved in circular references. Automatic Memory Management: The garbage collector operates automatically in the background, so developers don't need to manually allocate or deallocate memory. gc module: Python provides a gc module that allows developers to access and control the garbage collector, though it's generally not necessary to use it directly in most applications.\n","\n","# Q16-What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n","\n","A16-In Python, the else block in a try...except...else statement is used to define code that should run only if no exception was raised in the try block.\n","\n","# Q17-What are the common logging levels in python?\n","\n","A17-Python's logging module defines several standard logging levels, each representing a different severity of event. They are, in order of increasing severity: DEBUG (10): Detailed information, typically used for diagnosing problems. INFO (20): Confirmation that things are working as expected. WARNING (30): An indication that something unexpected happened, or might happen in the near future (e.g., 'disk space low'). The software is still working as expected. ERROR (40): Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function. CRITICAL (50): A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.\n","\n","# Q18-What is the differnce between os.fork() and multiprocessing in python?\n","\n","A18-In Python, os.fork() is a lower-level, OS-specific mechanism to create a new process, while multiprocessing provides a higher-level, portable framework for managing multiple processes and leveraging multiple CPU cores. os.fork() is limited to Unix-like systems and directly uses the operating system's fork call, creating a nearly identical copy of the parent process. multiprocessing, on the other hand, offers different start methods (including fork, spawn, and forkserver) and provides tools for inter-process communication and synchronization, making it more versatile and easier to use across different platforms.\n","\n","# Q19-What is the importance of closing a file in python?\n","\n","A19-Closing a file in Python is crucial for data integrity, resource management, and preventing potential problems. It ensures that all data is written to the file, frees up system resources, and avoids issues like file locking and resource leaks. Failing to close a file can lead to data loss or corruption, and impact the performance and stability of your program\n","\n","# Q20-What is the differnce between file.read() and file.readline() in python?\n","\n","A20-In Python, file.read() reads the entire file's content into a single string, while file.readline() reads and returns only the first line of the file, also as a string\n","\n","# Q21-What is the logging module in python used for?\n","\n","A21-The logging module is used to track events that happen when your code runs.
